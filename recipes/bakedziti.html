    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Baked ziti is a classic Italian-American dish featuring ziti pasta mixed with a rich tomato sauce, ricotta
        cheese, and often ground meat (like beef or sausage). It's layered with mozzarella cheese on top, which becomes
        golden and bubbly when baked. The dish is hearty, comforting, and typically served as a main course, making it a
        popular choice for family gatherings and potlucks. Its combination of flavors and textures makes it a beloved
        staple in many households.
