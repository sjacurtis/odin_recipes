        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Baked ziti is a classic Italian-American dish featuring ziti pasta mixed with a rich tomato sauce, ricotta
            cheese, and often ground meat (like beef or sausage). It's layered with mozzarella cheese on top, which becomes
            golden and bubbly when baked. The dish is hearty, comforting, and typically served as a main course, making it a
            popular choice for family gatherings and potlucks. Its combination of flavors and textures makes it a beloved
            staple in many households.
