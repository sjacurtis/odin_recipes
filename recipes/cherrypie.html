        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Cherry pie, famously associated with the TV series "Twin Peaks," is a classic American dessert known for its
            sweet, tart cherry filling encased in a flaky pie crust. In the show, it symbolizes comfort and nostalgia, often
            enjoyed by characters in the cozy, small-town diner. The iconic cherry pie became a cultural touchstone,
            representing the blend of wholesome Americana and the show's surreal, mysterious atmosphere. Its rich flavor and
            vibrant red color make it a beloved treat, both in the series and in real life.

            <li>1-1/2 c. flour</li>
            <li>1/2 c. Crisco</li>
            <li>1/4 c. ice water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 c. cherries (pitted, sour frozen)</li>
            <li>1 c. water</li>
            <li>1 c. Baker's sugar</li>
            <li>4 T. cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/8 t. salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix flour and Crisco with fork. Add ice water. Mix with your hands.</li>
            <li>When blended, roll into ball and refrigerate overnight.</li>
            <li>To roll out: flour both rolling pin and flat surface, split ball in two, roll out 1/2 to fit pan and 1/2 for lattice.</li>
            <li>Thaw cherries at room temp and strain (yields 2 c. juice). Taste for sweetness, more/less sugar may be needed.</li>
            <li>Add 1 c. water to make 3 c. juice (reserve 1 c. juice for cornstarch mix).</li>
            <li>Dissolve cornstarch in 1 c. juice, stir with whip.</li>
            <li>Combine 2 c. juice, 2/3 c. sugar, salt and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add cornstarch mix, cook until clear, about 5 min. (if cooked too long, syrup gets gummy).</li>
            <li>Remove from heat; stir in 1/3 c. sugar (blend thoroughly).</li>
            <li>Pour mixture over cherries, fold with wooden spoon, cool (stir mix while cooling to prevent scum from forming on top).</li>
            <li>Pour mix in pie shell. Top completed pie with lattice crust.</li>
            <li>Bake @ 425 F for 35 - 40 min.</li>
